    #Findings and Recomendations:
The analysis showed that as a group looking to expand its region nationally and internationally, Palmoria Manufacturing Group has some balanced gender distribution in it's organization, although the Male gender ranks highest in most department and salary payment. The need to ensure a more balanced gender rank in terms of department and salary payment is recomended. Palmoria may also seek to employ more female staffs with some, particular focus on the Legal department in Abuja region. Also the company should ensure every N/A employee reveal their gender so as to have a more appropriate data on the gender position in the organization, thus ensuring there's a more precise action to be taken.
